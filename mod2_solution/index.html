        A chicken is a farm animal with tiny legs that tastes good when cooked. They are very good in sandwiches, and in the form of buffalo wings.

        Beef
      </p>
      <p>
        Beef comes from a cow and is very good.  Typically, when you order beef at a restaurant, they will ask you how you would like it cooked.  You should never say well done...

        Sushi
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I understand, sushi is raw fish... I personally don't like sushi.  I have tried it several times and the texture/smell always make me have a tough time getting it down.  I will stick to chicken and beef.
